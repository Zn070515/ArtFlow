"""The 2025 historical questionnaire, and the step that fills it from the private fixture.

Before the questionnaire existed the loader wrote every participant's round-one group song
into the single ``SingerRegistration.song_name`` column, because that column was the only
place a song could go. It is not any more: four rounds each have their own song and their
own accompaniment, and they exist at once. Writing through the questionnaire services is
also what makes the fixture a rehearsal of the real flow rather than a bypass of it — the
draft is created, the answers go in, the participant submits, staff approve.

The shape below follows the 2025 院十佳 historical form: basic identity, then each round's
song and accompaniment, plus the third round's guest singer.
